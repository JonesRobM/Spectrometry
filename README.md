# Homemade Spectrometer with Webcam

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for a homemade spectrometer that uses a standard webcam for light detection. The spectrometer analyses light spectra and provides data on various wavelengths using a simple and affordable setup. This project is ideal for educational purposes, DIY enthusiasts, or anyone interested in building a basic spectrometer.

## Features

- **Webcam-Based Detection:** Utilises a common webcam to capture light spectra.
- **Spectral Analysis:** Processes and analyses the captured light data to produce a spectrum.
- **Visual Output:** Displays the results in an easy-to-understand format.

## Requirements

- **Hardware:**
  - A standard webcam
  - A diffraction grating (to separate light into its component wavelengths)
  - A light source (e.g., LED, lamp)
  - A stable mount or holder for the webcam and diffraction grating
